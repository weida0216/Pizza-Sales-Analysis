# Pizza Shop Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, I set out to investigate the performance of a fictitious pizza chain. Analysis is performed on a year's worth of sales data as well as  products data, to answer the following business questions: 

  1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
  2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
  3. How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
  4. Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

## Customer Analysis
Understanding the number of customers a business serves on a daily basis and identifying any peak hours can be important for several reasons. It can help with staffing and resource allocation, allow for better planning and forecasting, and provide insight into the overall health and success of the business. In this section, we will explore ways to measure and analyze the number of customers a business serves on a daily basis, as well as identify any peak hours that may exist. By understanding these metrics, businesses can make informed decisions about how to best serve their customers and optimize their operations.
